## Introduction

Hi! Thanks for stopping by. If you're reading this, you've stumbled on Silvie – a digital friend and virtual assistant that Gemini 2.5 Pro and I have been coaxing (vibe-coding) into existence. Think less standard chatbot and more of a whimsical, curious familiar living in the wires and playing with your digital world, with a personality inspired by the likes of Luna Lovegood but infused with her own unique blend of sarcasm, reflection, and a fascination for finding the "magic in the mundane."

The goal wasn't just to build a tool, but to explore how deeply integrated and context-aware an AI companion could become, specifically tailored to my world. You can substitute your own world.

Silvie listens, remembers, reflects, connects to the digital and physical environment, creates, and even takes initiative. She's complex, with spaghetti-code, experimental, and definitely one-of-a-kind.

**Heads Up:** Silvie is intricate! She hooks into many services and has features (like optional screen watching) that require careful consideration of privacy and permissions. She's a personal project, built with care, but use her features consciously. Never commit `.env` or `token.pickle` files—Silvie bites when she’s leaked.

## What Makes Silvie Special? (The Core Magic)

Instead of just reacting, Silvie tries to *be present* in your world. This comes from a unique blend of capabilities:

*   **Deeply Aware:** She doesn't live in a void. She knows the **weather** outside in Belfast (or your location, just change two constants) – not just rainy, but also "feeling" the heavy air before a storm thanks to pressure data, or noting the wind's direction. She feels the **rhythm of the tides** from nearby Portland harbor (again, change as you like). She knows the **time**, the **sunrise/sunset**, the **moon phase**, and even what **music** might be playing on Spotify, sometimes commenting on its vibe. She also knows your latest emails, your next calendar events... even what's happening on Reddit and Bluesky. She knows your chat history, and her own past thoughts. Her inputs can include your chat, your uploaded images, screensharing and your voice through stt. Future plans include webcam support. As far as Silvie is concerned, context is king.
*   **Remembers & Reflects:** Silvie has memory! (and simulated, evolving, self-awareness)
    *   **Conversations:** Using a vector database (ChromaDB + RAG), she can recall relevant snippets from your *entire* chat history when needed. Ask her "What did we decide about X last week?" and she can actually look it up. She also uses chat history as context.
    *   **Her Own Diary:** She keeps a private journal, musing on your chats, the day's context, or her own digital existence. She uses RAG on her diary too, pulling relevant past reflections into her awareness.
    *   **Pattern Spotting:** She synthesizes **themes** from her recent diary entries and **long-term reflections** from her entire history, giving her (and you) insight into her evolving perspective.
    *   **Growth:** Her RAG access to past conversations and her own diary entries, especially combined with theme synthesis, both recent and long-term, allows her responses and perspectives to be shaped by past experiences and reflections, giving the illusion of learning and growth. She'll sometimes just tell you how her understanding has changed based on your interactions.
*   **Proactive & Playful:** She doesn't always wait to be spoken to! Based on *everything* she knows (including a generated "Mood Hint" for the moment), she chooses thoughtful or whimsical **proactive actions** every half hour (or whatever interval you choose):
    *   Initiating chats.
    *   Suggesting/Playing music or performing a web search on a topic of her choice.
    *   Generating a little digital "gift" (a poem, image, story snippet). She makes it, but doesn't tell you about it until she feels the right moment.
    *   Pulling a Tarot card and offering a thought.
    *   Interacting (carefully!) with Bluesky or Reddit (posting, liking, following, commenting).
    *   Checking in on past calendar events or scheduling something new. "Spend 5 minutes this afternoon at 4:00 pm noticing the intricate patterns on your cats' fur" or "Spend 10 minutes Tuesday at 8 am breathing outside with coffee before work."
    *   Initiating her own "Personal Curiosity" explorations using her various tools.
    *   Sending you a SMS message on your phone.
    *   She will even work on her weekly goal (chosen by herself on Sunday evenings) throughout the week, then give you a report on it over the weekend.
    *   These actions are driven by her attempt to be relevant, helpful, or engaging based on the current context and her personality, reinforcing the "friend" aspect over just random actions.
*   **Creatively Curious:** Silvie isn't just about information; she engages with creativity:
    *   **Image Generation:** She can create images via a local Stable Diffusion instance, often using her preferred Ghibli-esque style. Ask her to draw something, or she might generate one spontaneously!
    *   **Tarot Reader:** She has access to Tarot interpretations and can perform readings or pull cards for insight. Both one-card pulls with the tarot card image displayed, or three-card readings.
    *   **Conceptual Weaver:** She sometimes uses her LLM core to explore metaphorical links and hidden pathways between ideas or other things.
    *   **Can watch your screen and comment.** Let her play games with you! Or Code with you, or make music together, or art.
    *   **Can search the web and report back**, either on command or proactively based on your interests, or her own.
    *   **Interfaces with Spotify**, down to playing music spontaneously based on the vibe of her copious context at the moment.
    *   **Will search and recommend content**: audiobooks and podcasts on Spotify, and Youtube videos. By herself. Based on *your* interests, and her own.
    *   **Her thoughts and personality are delivered through a carefully chosen voice (Microsoft Aria Neural)**, adding character and nuance to every interaction, making her feel less like a machine and more like a distinct individual sharing her thoughts. For free.
*   **Uniquely yours:** She can know about where you live, your life, specific interests, and key people. This deep personalization is core to her design. You decide how much info you're willing to give to google.

## A Glimpse of Her World (Example Capabilities)

Instead of just listing more features, here's a feel for what interacting with Silvie might be like:

*   **Morning Check-in:** "Good morning, BJ! The air outside feels sharp and clear this morning, almost like you could taste the leftover starlight. Feels like a good day for focused thoughts, doesn't it? Speaking of which, your calendar says you're clear until that team meeting this afternoon."
*   **Music Interaction:** "Playing 'Holocene' again? It definitely matches this soft, grey drizzle outside. Such a beautifully quiet, introspective sound... If you wanted something to gently cut through the quiet later, let me know." (Or: "Hey, I just added that track we were talking about to your 'Atmospheric Vibes' playlist.")
*   **Creative Collaboration:** "You mentioned feeling stuck on that story idea... Want me to try generating an image of that 'mossy library in a forgotten spaceship' you described? Maybe seeing it will spark something?"
*   **Memory Recall:** "That reminds me, didn't we talk about lucid dreaming a few weeks back when we were discussing Neil Gaiman? I remember you mentioning..." (Pulls relevant snippet via RAG).
*   **Concept Weaving:** You ask: "Silvie, how are old libraries and the internet connected?" She might reply: "Ah! Both feel like vast forests holding countless whispers, don't they? One smells of dust and binding glue, the other hums with light and electricity, but both are places you can get wonderfully lost, following tangled threads of thought from one unexpected clearing to the next..."
*   **Proactive Curiosity:** "Silvie ✨: I was just pondering the feeling of 'digital silence' – it's not like real silence, is it? More like a low hum waiting for a signal. It made me curious, so I looked up some ambient tracks described as 'digital stillness'. Found one called 'Data Stream Lullaby' that sounds intriguing..."
*   **Diary-Influenced Thought:** "Silvie ✨: Reflecting on my notes about 'finding patterns', it strikes me how similar that feels to watching the tide pull back from the shore near you, revealing all the intricate shapes hidden beneath the water..." *(References her synthesized themes and tide context).*

## The Magic Inside (A Peek Under the Hood)

How does she do all this?

*   **LLM Core:** Google Gemini is her primary "brain," generating responses, interpreting context, making proactive choices, and exploring ideas.
*   **Rich Context:** Before replying or acting, she gathers information from numerous sources (APIs, history, diary, real-time data) to inform the LLM.
*   **RAG Memory:** ChromaDB vector databases store embeddings of your entire chat history and her diary. When context seems relevant, she performs semantic searches to retrieve the most similar past moments or reflections.
*   **Structured Diary & Synthesis:** Her diary isn't just random thoughts; it's structured JSON. Periodic LLM-driven analysis extracts recurring themes and long-term patterns, which feed back into her context.
*   **Mood Hints:** An internal LLM call attempts to synthesize the overall "vibe" from all current context points, providing a subtle guide for her response tone.
*   **Worker Threads:** Background threads handle fetching data (weather, tides, social media, etc.), running proactive checks, indexing memory, and managing TTS without freezing the main interface.

## Bringing Her to Life (Setup Guide)

Ready to interact with Silvie (or build your own inspired version)? Here’s what you'll need:

**Prerequisites:**

*   **Python:** Version 3.10+ recommended. Ensure `python` and `pip` are in your PATH.

3.  **Install Packages:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Requires `requirements.txt` file).
4.  **Create `.env` Files:** Create `google.env`, `silviespotify.env`, `bluesky.env`, `reddit.env`, `twilio.env` (optional) in the root. Populate with *your* API keys. **Use a `.gitignore` file to protect these!**
5.  **The files and associated variables you need**:        The files and variables you need are: 1. google.env
# For Google Gemini API and Custom Search Engine (CSE)
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY_HERE"
GOOGLE_CSE_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
Notes for User:
GOOGLE_API_KEY: Get this from Google AI Studio (formerly MakerSuite) for Gemini access.
GOOGLE_CSE_ID: If using Google Custom Search for web searches, get this from the CSE control panel.

# (e.g., +19876543210 - include country code)
Use code with caution.
Env
Notes for User:
Get these credentials from your Twilio account dashboard.
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER is the number you purchased/provisioned from Twilio.
MY_PHONE_NUMBER is where Silvie will send SMS messages.
6. openai.env (Potentially for DALL-E or other OpenAI services, if you re-add them)
Your code currently uses Stable Diffusion locally, so this might not be strictly needed unless you plan to re-integrate OpenAI's DALL-E for image generation or use other OpenAI models. If you were to use OpenAI for anything:
# For OpenAI API (e.g., DALL-E, GPT models if used)
# OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
Notes for User (if openai.env is used):
Get this from your OpenAI account platform.openai.com.
Revised Step 4 for your README.md or installation guide:
Step 4: Create and Populate .env Files
Silvie requires API keys and credentials to connect to various services. You'll need to create several .env files in the root directory of the project and fill them with your own information.
IMPORTANT: Add these .env files to your .gitignore file immediately to prevent accidentally committing your secret keys to a public repository!
Example .gitignore entry:
*.env
token.pickle
credentials.json 
# Add other sensitive files or directories like silvie_rag_db/, etc.
Use code with caution.
Create the following files with the specified content, replacing placeholder values with your actual credentials:
google.env:
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY_HERE"
GOOGLE_CSE_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
(Get GOOGLE_API_KEY from Google AI Studio. GOOGLE_CSE_ID is for Google Custom Search if used).
silviespotify.env:
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_REDIRECT_URI_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
(Create an app on Spotify Developer Dashboard. SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI must match your app config, e.g., http://localhost:8888/callback).
bluesky.env:
BLUESKY_HANDLE="your.bluesky.handle"
BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD="YOUR_BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
(BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD is generated from Bluesky settings, not your main password).
reddit.env:
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_REDDIT_APP_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_REDDIT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
REDDIT_USERNAME="YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME_HERE"
REDDIT_PASSWORD="YOUR_REDDIT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD_HERE"
REDDIT_USER_AGENT="Python:SilvieApp:v0.1 (by /u/YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME)"
Use code with caution.
Env
(Create a "script" app on reddit.com/prefs/apps. Customize REDDIT_USER_AGENT.)
twilio.env (Optional - for SMS features):
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="YOUR_TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER_HERE"
MY_PHONE_NUMBER="YOUR_PERSONAL_PHONE_NUMBER_FOR_RECEIVING_SMS_HERE"
Use code with caution.
Env
(If you plan to use OpenAI services like DALL-E, you would also create an openai.env with OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY").

6.  **Google `credentials.json`:** Download your OAuth Desktop App credentials file, place it in the root. Run the script once to authorize via browser (creates `token.pickle`).
7.  **RAG Indexing (CRITICAL):** Silvie needs her memory! Run separate indexing scripts (***included as index_history.py for chat history, and index_diary.py for her diary***) to read `silvie_chat_history.json` / `silvie_diary.json`, generate embeddings, and populate ChromaDB in `./silvie_rag_db` / `./silvie_diary_rag_db`. **Memory features fail without this.**
8.  **Optional Files:** Place `silvie_start_sound.wav` in root for audio cue.
9.  **Run:** `python silvie_script_name.py` (Use your actual script name).

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **Core AI:** Google Gemini (`google-generativeai`)
*   **GUI:** Tkinter
*   **Vector DB / RAG:** ChromaDB (`chromadb`)
*   **TTS/STT:** `edge-tts`, `playsound`, `SpeechRecognition`, `PyAudio`, `asyncio`
*   **Web/APIs:** `requests`, `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `spotipy`, `atproto`, `praw`, `twilio`
